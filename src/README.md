# Example workflows

A number of workflows are provided to introduce new users to the core concepts and design principles of building an aeon experiment from scratch, including instantiation and control of devices and logging of all events across the system. These go from a simplest, single camera setup to a more complete arena with multiple types of device and data stream, and multiple devices of each type.
